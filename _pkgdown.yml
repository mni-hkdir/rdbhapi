    The `rdbhapi` package provides a user-friendly R interface to interact with
    the [DBH-API](https://dbh.hkdir.no/dbhapiklient/) for open data access.
    This API offers comprehensive data on higher education statistics in Norway,
    enabling seamless access to datasets related to institutions, programs,
    students, and more.

    Designed for researchers, analysts, and developers, `rdbhapi` simplifies
    integration with the Database for Statistics on Higher Education, making it
